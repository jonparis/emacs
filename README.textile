h1. My emacs configuration

Please note that much of this is cribbed straight from Chris Wanstrath's config at http://github.com/defunkt/emacs, with pieces from Jim Weirich's configuration as well: http://github.com/jimweirich/emacs-setup/. 

check into ~/.emacs.d

cd into ~/.emacs.d/

Run the following commands:

 git submodule init
 git submodule update

The rinari submodule in vendor/rinari has submodules of it's own, so we need to repeat the process:

 cd vendor/rinari
 git submodule init
 git submodule update

Finally, create a file called ~/.emacs and place the following two lines in it:

 (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d")
 (load "~/.emacs.d/init.el")

You can put local configurations in config/custom.el. Any passwords should go in ~/.emacs.d/.passwords. Both of these files are ignored by Git.
